* A Multithreaded Rust Demo

An example of a fake game, with an expensive calculation that can be
pushed off to another thread.

There will be a blog post to explain this better, coming soon on
[[https://www.worthe-it.co.za]].

This example is based on a Piston game engine tutorial written by
TyOverby <ty@pre-alpha.com> and Nikita Pekin <contact@nikitapek.in>
