* A Multithreaded Rust Demo

An example of a fake game, with an expensive calculation that can be
pushed off to another thread.

There will be a blog post to explain this better, coming soon on
[[https://www.worthe-it.co.za]].

* Running

This demo shows two cases, one that uses threading for an 'expensive'
calculation and one that does now.

The version without threading can be run with 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo run --bin no-thread
#+END_SRC

The version that does uses threads, and communicates its results back
to the parent thread with a channel, can be run with

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo run --bin channels
#+END_SRC
